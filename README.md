# Gross Profit Margin Calculator

Retail businesses often have a hard time calculating the selling price of products according to gross profit margin percentage.
Due to this retailers often rely on the suggested retail price from the delivery sheet for products they receive from the wholesaler.

## So how does this app work?

- Enter your cost price of the product
- Enter the desired profit margin percentage at which you want to sell the product
- Hit enter or click Calculate & Boom - get your selling price of your product

## How did I code this app?

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery
- BootStrap (I'm a flexbox fan who just started exploring BootStrap for responsiveness)

I wrote the JavaScript code using ES6 & jQuery using MVC pattern keeping the model/data always updated as the user performs the calculation, all the methods follow the DOT(Do One Thing) rule. I used composition in coding.

## Best parts about this app

- works responsively across all devices
- visually impaired users will perfectly be able to navigate just using keyboard & screenreader
- meets UX principles for proper navigation
